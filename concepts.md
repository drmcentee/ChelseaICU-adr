Reduces admin overhead
	No waiting for someone to approve
	Editing/creating can happen when needed 
Authentication allows things to be tracked, versions allow rollback if needed

## Git
Change history is baked in

### Slack
Industry standard communication
Plays well with other services and hence automation
Can act as a login service for apps - offloads storage of data to a track proven service
Segregates work chat to a work chat app - WhatsApp for personal

## Infrastructure as code
Docker compose and other services should be configured via text/automation where possible. This allows a system to be spun up with minimal manual input.
